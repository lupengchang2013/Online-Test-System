Online-Test-System
==================

This is a online test system for Boge Driving School based on J2EE.


This project was to build an on-line test system used to help enrolled students get prepared for writen test. There are two different perspectives – teacher and student – in the system. 
For the teacher, managing test question and students functions are provided. For students, taking the exam is the primary function.
